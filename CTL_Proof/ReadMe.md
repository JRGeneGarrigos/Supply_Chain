Summary
------------------------------
CLT is one of the greatest theorems of statistics. 

the objective of this script is to proof CLT.

the proof has 5 steps:
1- Create synthetic data with 6 different distributions.
2- Filling the population with the synthetic data the 6 distributions
3- Define the number of measures of each sample (sample_size),
   and the number of samples (number_samples).
4- Defining the sample means array
5- Plotting the results as a histogram

Note: the code has more comments to clarify each of the steps
